Extending
=========

The XMPP Toolkit library allows you to easily implement your own
**XEPs** and keep the extensions inside of your own application.

If you are implementing a generic XEP, please consider sending a
pull-request with the change, preferabbly along with its test cases.


Acknowledgements
================

This library was mostly written from scratch, except for the
``xmpp.sasl`` which is a modified copy of the contents of the
`pyxmpp2 <https://github.com/Jajcus/pyxmpp2>`_ library by `Jacek Konieczny <https://github.com/Jajcus>`_.
